If a creature affected by this jutsu has 0 Hit die, they take additional necrotic damage equal to your level on a hit.* If the creature is considered an adversary, it loses 1 Tenacity die.

When a Shadow Clone is killed, it sends its most recent experiences within the last minute as thoughts and images to its Summoner. A Shadow Clone presents itself as its own person. A creature looking at a Shadow Clone with chakra sight cannot tell that it is not a real person unless otherwise specified.  This jutsu's caster can further enhance its casting. By doing this the caster can create up to 4 Shadow Clones at once, each costing 6 chakra per clone created. All Shadow Clones act at once and attempt to perform the same command given. If commanded to perform the help action, they can only help the Summoner. Shadow Clones do not have Reactions and each clone has basic versions of your melee or ranged weapons. Weapons your Shadow Clone is summoned with that has the ammunition property cannot be given to anyone.  Shadow Clones can only cast jutsu of C-Rank or lower. Damaging jutsu casted by a Shadow Clone deals half damage and uses the relevant ability score, attack bonus and saving throw, instead of only your Ninjutsu attack bonus. If a Shadow Clone casts a jutsu that requires more than 1 attack roll upon casting, it only makes one attack. If multiple shadow clones attack the same creature, you do not make multiple attack rolls. You instead choose a lead clone and it gains a +1d4 bonus to its damage roll(s), for each additional clone that is aiding it.  At Higher Ranks: If this jutsu is cast at B-Rank or higher, increase the cost of each clones summoned by this jutsu by3. For each rank above C-Rank, increase the number of clones you can create with this jutsu by 2. If this jutsu is cast at A-Rank, Shadow Clones you summon can cast jutsu of B-Rank or lower, and for every 2 Shadow Clones you have active at once, increase your AC by +1."

If you choose a surface, the seal can cover an area of the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that object must remain in its place; if the object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this jutsu, the seal is broken and this jutsu ends without being triggered.  The seal is nearly invisible, requiring an Investigation or Ninshou check vs your ninjutsu save DC to find it.  You decide what triggers the seal when you cast the jutsu. For seals inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or stepping on the seal, removing another object covering it, approaching within a certain distance of it, or manipulating the object that holds it.  You can further refine the trigger so the jutsu is activated only under certain circumstances or according to a creature's physical characteristics (such as height or weight). You can also specify creatures that don't trigger the seal, such as those who say a certain password.  When you inscribe the seal, you can store a Ninjutsu or Genjutsu of B-Rank or lower in the seal by casting it as part of creating the seal. The jutsu must target a single creature or an area. The jutsu being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way. When the seal is triggered, the stored jutsu is cast. If the jutsu has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the seal. If the jutsu affects an area, the area is centered on that creature. If the jutsu summons hostile creatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to the intrude and attack it. If the jutsu requires concentration, it lasts until the end of its full duration.

You regain chakra points equal to the amount lost.  If you attempt to cast this jutsu on an unwilling creature, you make a melee ninjutsu attack. On a hit, you then attempt to drain their chakra as normal.  Additionally, if you reduce a creatures Hit points to 0 as a result of this jutsu, you are temporarily able to steal their nature release from them, if they have any.  Until you complete a long rest, you randomly gain one of the target creatures nature release and one random jutsu of C-Rank or lower, that requires that nature release that they knew. You cannot learn additional jutsu of the stolen nature release unless you already have the chosen nature affinity.

Within the sphere, Ninjutsu or Genjutsu can't be cast, and chakra items become mundane. Until the jutsu ends, the sphere moves with you, centered on you.  Jutsu and other chakra-based effects except those created by an S-Ranked Artifact or Sage are suppressed in the sphere and can't protrude into it. Chakra spent to cast a suppressed jutsu is lost. While an effect is suppressed, it doesn't function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration.  Targeted Effects. Jutsu and other chakra effects such as Flame bolt or Doubled Pain, that target a creature or an object in the sphere have no effect on that target.  Areas of Chakra. The area of another jutsu or chakra effect such as Fireball, can't extend into the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an area of chakra, the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed. For example, the winds created by Wall of wind are suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is large enough.  Jutsu. Any active jutsu or other chakra effect on a creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it.  Chakra items. The properties and abilities of chakra items are suppressed in the sphere. For example, a +1 Katana in the sphere functions as a non-chakra enhanced katana. A Chakra weapons properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If a chakra weapon or piece of chakra enhanced ammunition fully leaves the sphere."

All creatures within the cylinder must make a Dexterity and Constitution saving throw.

A Suffocating creature can only survive a number of rounds equal to their constitution modifier before passing out falling unconscious from the lack of air. A creature makes this saving throw at the beginning of each turn they begin within cylinder. An unconscious creature can regain consciousness when another creature spends an action waking them.  Creatures inside the cylinder cannot gain the benefits of an increase to movement speed and are treated as if they are in difficult terrain.

On a failure, the brand burns them, restricting chakra flow as they lose the ability to mold chakra until the beginning of their next turn.  Creatures can make a Ninshou skill Check as an action vs your Ninjutsu save DC to break the seal ending this jutsu."

Once touched by another creature or object or violently shaken, it disappears in a puff of smoke.

While this charm lasts, you can affect the target's memory of an event that it experienced within the last 12 Months and that lasted no more than 1 Day.  You can Temporarily overwrite all memory of the event, allow the target to recall the event with perfect clarity and exacting detail, change its memory of the details of the event, or create a memory of some other event.  You must speak to the target to describe how its memories are affected and it must be able to understand your language for the modified memories to take root. Its mind fills in any gaps in the details of your description. If the jutsu ends before you have finished describing the modified memories, the creature's memory isn't altered.  The modified memories take hold when the jutsu ends. A modified memory doesn't necessarily affect how a creature behaves, particularly if the memory contradicts the creature's natural inclinations, allegiance, or beliefs. An illogical modified memory is dismissed, perhaps as a bad dream. The DM might deem a modified memory too nonsensical to affect a creature in a significant manner.

You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as -Attack that creature-, -Run over there-, or -Fetch that object-. If the creature completes the order and doesn't receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability.  You can use your action to take total and precise control of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the creature takes only the actions you choose, and doesn't do anything that you don't allow it to do. During this time, you can also cause the creature to use a reaction, but this requires you to use your own reaction as well.

If this would cause the attack to miss, you can make a melee weapon attack as a part of the same reaction, as long as the target is within range.* As a bonus action, you can make 2 melee weapon attacks.* As an action you can take the dash action and make 3 melee weapon attacks.* As a full turn action, you make use of all of your weapons and strike with them. Make five melee weapon attacks, once with each weapon. If they all hit, the creature is stunned until the end of their next turn.* All of these benefits are only applicable while using Tanto. Switching to a different weapon or even holding a weapon that is not a Tanto will automatically end this jutsu."
